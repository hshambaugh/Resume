<h3>Quarterly Excellece Award - 1st QTR 2020</h3>
Harry is a young man of very few words and much action...2020 has given him much action thus far, let's examine:
The year started with gearing up for 1099 document printing and submission to IRS.  We must run reports from Origami and Dynamics and aggregate based on TIN so that we are only submitting a single form for each TIN...the IRS can penalize us if they get multiple.  After learning that within Origami there were multiple records for the same TIN in the test data, Harry quickly identified duplicate TINs and alerted appropriate parties.  He then went to an Origami conference to get more insight into that product, returned and got the 1099s out the door (mailed and electronic filing) on time with the help of teammates from RMIS, Accounting and Office services.
Harry continued to work with Leslie and Denise on the Board Evaluation reporting automation while on his Origami adventure.  The Board Evaluation reporting project has had a couple of adventure trails of its own but Harry has kept a good attitude and appreciation of the fact that Leslie needed to revise the questions, and he is now close to having the revised set of reports complete.
To add to Harry's action, we had a hardware refresh planned for 2020 but didn't realize that the hardware would start arriving weeks earlier than anticipated.  Harry took it upon himself to replace all of our monitors himself instead of waiting for Lewan to assist us during the actual swap of the laptops.  I anticipated that the hardware refresh would take us 3-4 weeks in total but his forethought of getting the monitors swapped out weeks ahead of the new laptops arriving saved us time at each user's workstation, allowed the hardware to be replaced in days rather than weeks, and it saved us quite a bit of money by not having Lewan's team in the space for those weeks.  Harry even learned to speak and operate the MacBook better during the refresh process.

I appreciate all he has done and anticipate that he will do much more.  Let's give him a big THANK YOU!</p>


<p>
Thanks for all your hard work and positive attitude.

<p>Harry Shambaugh – thanks so much for getting me set up as a new employee in 2019, all our trouble shooting, and sharing your humor.  
  Also, thank you for letting me borrow a projector for a workshop.  It’s been sitting in my garage during Covid. 
<br>

<p>[you bring] ...a wealth of knowledge in work and life…THANK YOU HARRY for your hard work, dedication, and friendship.  I’m not sure what it will be like without a morning goofy joke to start my day or just make me laugh when I’m stressed.  Thank you for sharing so much knowledge and helping me understand how you built the invoice app.  You’re AMAZING.

<p>Harry, you dived into the board evaluation frying pan head-first, always smiling and excited, overcoming multitudes of obstacles, all while juggling so many other IT projects, but you more than successfully streamlined the data compilation and reporting process. 
  I honestly don’t know how I would have gotten through 4th quarter/2021 with so many fall board evalutations while converting onsite modules to virtual delivery.  THANK YOU!  You are such a dedicated achiever, a highly valuable and caring team member, and a joyful inspiration and blessing to everyone!  Thank you for your huge contribution to Governance and FCCS  
<br>
  Denise Pade</p>

<p>Thank you, Harry for your enthusiasm, and dedication to helping us all out!

<p>Harry –...Words are an inadequate device to convey the feelings you instill in others through your actions.  
  I treasure our conversations, past and future.  Your presence is always positive, your eagerness to help others rivaled only by Sybil [Company Receptionist], and kindness instilled in everything I witnessed. 
<br>
   Ray Wilber</p>

<p>Harry, it was a treat to work with you, always to helpful and eager to pitch in!
