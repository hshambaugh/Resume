<h3>Quarterly Excellece Award - 1st QTR 2020</h3>
Harry is a young man of very few words and much action...2020 has given him much action thus far, let's examine:
The year started with gearing up for 1099 document printing and submission to IRS.  We must run reports from Origami and Dynamics and aggregate based on TIN so that we are only submitting a single form for each TIN...the IRS can penalize us if they get multiple.  After learning that within Origami there were multiple records for the same TIN in the test data, Harry quickly identified duplicate TINs and alerted appropriate parties.  He then went to an Origami conference to get more insight into that product, returned and got the 1099s out the door (mailed and electronic filing) on time with the help of teammates from RMIS, Accounting and Office services.
Harry continued to work with Leslie and Denise on the Board Evaluation reporting automation while on his Origami adventure.  The Board Evaluation reporting project has had a couple of adventure trails of its own but Harry has kept a good attitude and appreciation of the fact that Leslie needed to revise the questions, and he is now close to having the revised set of reports complete.
To add to Harry's action, we had a hardware refresh planned for 2020 but didn't realize that the hardware would start arriving weeks earlier than anticipated.  Harry took it upon himself to replace all of our monitors himself instead of waiting for Lewan to assist us during the actual swap of the laptops.  I anticipated that the hardware refresh would take us 3-4 weeks in total but his forethought of getting the monitors swapped out weeks ahead of the new laptops arriving saved us time at each user's workstation, allowed the hardware to be replaced in days rather than weeks, and it saved us quite a bit of money by not having Lewan's team in the space for those weeks.  Harry even learned to speak and operate the MacBook better during the refresh process.

I appreciate all he has done and anticipate that he will do much more.  Let's give him a big THANK YOU!</p>
